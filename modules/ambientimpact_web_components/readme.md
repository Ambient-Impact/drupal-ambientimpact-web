This module provides an overview page and individual pages to view details about
available Ambient.Impact Components. This is primarily intended for
[ambientimpact.com](https://ambientimpact.com/web/components), but is reusable.
Note that this module will display all Component configuration and libraries to
users with the ```view ambientimpact component pages``` permission, so if you
don't want certain roles to have access to this information, make sure they
don't have that permission.
